# Architecture Options

Creating code that is well organised and easy to read, modify or expand upon is an important skill to have as a developer, especially when working in a team of developers. Using architecture is a good tool to do this. There are different architecture options suited to different video games and different development teams. We should aim to strike a balance between using architecture that the team is familiar with, while also ensuring it is the best option for the sort of game we are making.
Good architecture can save time in the long run, particularly as a project's code grows, but as a team we must not become overly focused on the architecture itself. Doing this would cost us a lot of the limited time we have to create the project.
