# Constraints 

## This Page will Expand on the Contraints Outlined in Project Justification
1.  The Team has a tight Time frame for this project. this means that certain decisions will need to be made quickly which may lead to a imperfect product.
    one way to combat this Constraint is to create a plan and conduct sprints in order to stay on pace for the project and finish it on time

2. Overall the teams Experience in the Unity Engine is lower than that of other equivalent engines which can also lead to an imperfect product

3. The Stealth genre is one that all 3 members of the team have never worked on before. Due to this the team may be unfamiliar with certain ways to program this type of game
   the group has been given a detailed brief on how the client wants the game and will be doing research on the genre which hopefully will not make this an issue
