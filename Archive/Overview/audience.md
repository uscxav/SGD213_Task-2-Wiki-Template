# Audience

## This Page will outline the intended Audience of the game
For this project the team are tackling a Stealth Game. due to this anyone who enjoys the genre would be inclined to play the prototype
the game will be aimed at people of all ages with relatively simple Enemies such as a camera that monitors a single spot and a Sentry
that goes from one spot to another. The Player Controller that Ian wants is also quite simple being a character that can move
and crouch meaning that anyone that can pick up a controller could understand the games goal within a few minutes.
