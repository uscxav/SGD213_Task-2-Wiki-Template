# Risks

## This Section will outline the Risks taken on with this project
1. Unity and C# are excellent prototyping tools, but working quickly often means less than perfect code. due to the nature of this project the team will be on a time limit
   but will attempt to plan proper time needed to test all required functions and scripts in the game
   
2. Bugs may be present in prototype due to the short turn-around. once again due to the short Time limit the project may have bugs.
   the team will be working to make the project as clean as possible allowing time for bug tests and script reviews

3.  Working quickly is error-prone and lack of experience in the engine could allow the team to fall behind. the team has been building their knowledge
   of Unity and C# over the semester and will aim to be as competent and professional as possible on this project
