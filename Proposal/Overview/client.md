# Client

## This page will go over everything we have learned from the client (Ian) and information he has given us regarding his wants for the project


## Intentions and Brief
Hello, Ian here. I need a base stealth game made so I can continue to work on creating assets for it. It doesnâ€™t need to be pretty. I need a base working player 
controller that can walk and crouch. I also need sentries that patrol back and forth between two points (That can be changed by myself). Cameras that are 
stationary and scan an area. Interaction with doors and boxes. Lastly, I need these scanning abilities to be blocked by the environment so that the 
player can walk and crouch behind things.

The Main Details initially gathered from Ians brief were:
1. A player controller that moves and crouches
2. Enemies/sentries that move between 2 points
3. Cameras that look at one spot
4. Boxes/walls that can be hidden behind

### First Email
Hi Ian,

We are The Wicked Crew, A small local Group of passionate game developers who are excited to bring your project to life. We love the idea of a stealth game and are 
excited to get to work on the project, we just have a few questions/points to iron out as we plane the development process

1. In your brief you mention the player controller and the different guards/sentries trying to track them down, but would you like any way for the player to fight back in anyway. 
whether this is my allowing the player to do sneak attacks on guard or possibly being able to throw object at guards/at walls to lure them away.

2. For enemies and cameras sight cones would you like the to be visible to the player or would you like the player to figure that out on their own, possibly through visual cues.

3. Would you like enemies to possibly have different states such as calm and collected, curious over a noise they heard or alerted and panicked after they have seen the player. 
these different states could be shown by having different symbols above and enemies head such as a ? or a !.

4. Do you want the game to have a story element (even if minor) and if yes what kind of direction would you like it to take


5. this one is a follow-up to the last one about the game's direction but in the brief, you mention that the art doesn't need to be pretty. we still want to give 
the game a nice visual feel so what direction would you possibly like that to take. whether its a dark gritty game, a colorful game, futuristic or historic we are all ears


Those are our Five biggest Questions so far but if we have anymore burning inside of us, we will ask you for some input. If there is also anything else you would like that doesn't pertain to these questions feel free to let us know and we will try our hardest to make this game the best it can be. thank you for your time and will chat to you soon

Kind Regards,
Kale Grabish, The Wicked Crew

### Response
1. 
    It's not needed for this project. Although, if there's time I'd be happy to see some feature added.
2.
    Visual cues would work well here to indicate that the player was caught.
3.
    Some alert state would work fine here. Although, given the time limits having enemies go from patrolling to "found player" would work.
4.
    I'm happy for you to make a premise for the game! Although, it's not needed
5.
    I'd assume this to be in a darker setting given the stealth nature. Although, I'm happy for you to use any assets needed. It only really needs grey boxes
