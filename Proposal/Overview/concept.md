# Concept 

## This Page will go over the overall concept of the game and the teams intentions behind it
While we were only requested to make a functional framework for the game prototype, we intend to also use this chance to experiment with level design and general gameplay flow of our prototype. While this will not be immediately beneficial to us, the client will benefit from feedback and experimentation early in development. This will involve close communication between our team and the client as we implement and refine systems. We intend to tweak these systems to meet needs for the game as we learn more of its style, genre, and how its gameplay will shape the environment.
