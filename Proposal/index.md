## Statement of Works
[//]: # (This section is about managing expectations; list out all of the qualities that will be in the final product)

### Requirements
* A base working Player Controller that can move and crouch
* Sentries that move back and forth between two points (that can be changed by Ian)
* Cameras that are stationary and scan an area
* Interaction with Doors and Boxes
* Scanning needs to be blocked by walls/crates so players can hide from enemies/cameras

### Expectations
* Project delivered on time
* Weekly updates on progress
* Communication with the client when design issues encountered
* Does **not** need to look pretty or require high quality art

### Assumptions
[//]: # (What are you assuming based on client responses)
* UI art does not need to be high quality, will just use basic Unity UI sprites
* Particles will be important, but since we shouldn't spend time on art, will use standard asset or free particle assets
