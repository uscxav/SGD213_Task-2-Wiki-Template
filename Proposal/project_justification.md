## Overview
Stealth game that the client Ian will be able to add assets to and continue working on. game will be a relatively basic prototype with a basic player controller and setries/cameras that try and hunt the player down
### Brief
Hello, Ian here. I need a base stealth game made so I can continue to work on creating assets for it. It doesnâ€™t need to be pretty. I need a base working player controller that can walk and crouch.
I also need sentries that patrol back and forth between two points (That can be changed by myself). Cameras that are stationary and scan an area. 
Interaction with doors and boxes. Lastly, I need these scanning abilities to be blocked by the environment so that the player can walk and crouch behind things.

### Communication
* When do you need this prototype by?
> I need the prototype by Sunday Week 13.

## Project Understanding


### Requirements
* A base working Player Controller that can move and crouch
 * sentries that move back and forth between 2 points (that can be changed by Ian)
 * Cameras that are stationary and scan an area
 * Interaction with Doors and Boxes
 * scanning needs to be blocked by walls/crates so players can hide from enemies/cameras

### Expectations
Project delivered on time
 * Weekly updates on progress
 * Communication with the client when design issues encountered
 * Does **not** need to look pretty or require high quality art
     
### Assumptions
[//]: # (What are you assuming based on client responses)
* UI art does not need to be high quality, will just use basic Unity UI sprites
* Particles will be important, but since we shouldn't spend time on art, will use standard asset or free particle assets

### Risks
* Unity and C# are excellent prototyping tools, but working quickly often means less than perfect code
* Bugs may be present in prototype due to the short turn-around
* Working quickly is error-prone and lack of experience in the engine could allow the team to fall behind
  

### Risk Management
* weekly team reports for scoping out the project and keeping the team on track
* the stealth genre is quite new to the team so managing that will be important

## Constraints

### Constraints
[//]: # (What are the constraints of this project)
* We have a tight timeframe, so we will need to make fast decisions, which may be less than perfect

## Justification
We really like the mention of "silly games catch people's eyes". So we took your suggestion of dragons and built on it with alliteration as a starting point. We went through many ideas, but finally came up with a title called "Donuts, Daggers & Dragons.

The name along was enough to get conversation happening, and we soon found ourselves thinking of countless, comical and enjoyable scenarios stemming from the title.

etc. Explain your design decisions in regards to the client's requirements.
